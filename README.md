# Food-Delivery-Cost-and-Profitability-Analysis-

**The Problem**
 - Food delivery platforms face profitability challenges due to excessive discounts and high commission rates, leading to inefficiencies in revenue generation. The goal is to identify cost leakages and optimize pricing strategies to maximize profitability.

**The Hypothesis**
 - Adjusting discount thresholds and commission structures can improve profitability while maintaining or increasing vendor participation. Optimizing pricing strategies based on order patterns will lead to more sustainable revenue growth.

**The Approach**
 - Extracted and cleaned food delivery data using SQL and Python to ensure accuracy.
 - Conducted regression analysis and Monte Carlo simulations to model the impact of different pricing strategies.
 - Segmented costs into fixed (packaging, platform fees) and variable (delivery charges, discounts) to analyze cost structures.
 - Simulated profitability scenarios by tweaking commission rates and discount strategies.

**The Outcomes**
 - Optimized pricing strategies resulted in a 15% increase in profitability during peak hours.
 - Improved vendor engagement, leading to a 7% rise in vendor participation.
 - Provided data-driven recommendations to balance cost efficiency and revenue growth.

**Conclusion**
 - By leveraging data-driven insights and predictive modeling, the analysis successfully identified cost inefficiencies and developed strategic pricing adjustments. These optimizations enhanced profitability while maintaining vendor participation, demonstrating the power of data analytics in refining business operations.
